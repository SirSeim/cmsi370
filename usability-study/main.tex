    \label{Introduction}

    Our usability study focused on the reading experiences brought by iBooks and Kindle on the iOS platform.
    For our three metrics, we chose learnability, efficiency, and errors. Learnability and efficiency are measured in seconds, while satisfaction is measured on a scale of 1-10: 1 being completely unhappy, 10 being extremely satisfied. Our tests included:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Searching for and downloading a specific book
        \item Highlighting and making a note in the text
        \item Search for a specific quote in the book
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Analysis}
    \label{Analysis}

    \subsection{Learnability}
    In terms of learnability, iBooks had the quickest times. They were able to very quickly pick up the interfaces for downloading books, highlighting and making notes, and searching within the book. The only consistent complaint with iBooks was with the downloading task. Some users were seaching for the book and accidentally tried to download the whole collectio of books that book was a part of. For the task of highlighting and making a note, the only problem to come up for some users was the technique of highlighting. There was no readily available information while reading the book that makes it apparent that holding down on the text brings up the manifying glass and starts the selection. It you find yourself at the notes and highlights are where you would go to look at your past highlights and notes, if you don't have any you are given instructions on how to make a highlight which is a good use of the space than simply saying there are no highlights or notes. The other thing that confused users was the appearance of what looked like textual tools when in-text. This discouraged the attempt of using the iOS text selection gesture that appears throughout the system. Searching within the book had no remarkable errors or user complaints other than user typos. 

    Kindle had some interesting reponses with users. For the first task of downloading the book, the most important thing to note is that you cannot purchase and download a book from within the Kindle application on iOS. You must go out to the internet to purchase it. This was most users complaint about this task, as it meant they wuld have to go to the a webbrowser to purchase a book and then start reading it in the app. Various people tended to use either a google search to get to the book purchasing page or go to amazon.com and use their search function. The quicker results tended to be the users using a google search which can be done directly form the webbrowser without having to go to another site. For the second task of highlighting and making a note, the most common error was where the user would select some text and make a note on it and expect the selected text to also be highlighted. iBooks did conform to this expectation and many users took advtange of it. For the third task of searching the book, the most common error was that users were expecting the search to be live-updating. That is to say that the expectation was that as they would type into search, results would start coming up immediately. The Kindle app chose not to include this mechanic.

    By way of the quicker times and the fewer user errors, iBooks takes the trophy for better app in terms of learnability.

    \subsection{Efficiency}
    In terms of effiiency, both apps performed veyr well. iBooks tended to perform better in the download task. This can likely be associated with being able to purchase and download books within iBooks whereas one would have to purchase a book for Kindle from a webbrowser. For the tasks of highlighting and making a note, and searching within the book, neither app showed a significant advantage. There were also no major complaints about either app once the user had become proficient at using both apps.
